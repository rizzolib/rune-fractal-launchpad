# Rune-Fractal Launchpad

The Rune Token Launchpad, which operates on the Rune protocol within the Fractal Bitcoin Network, serves as a platform for listing newly created Rune tokens and showcasing their minting progress. It enables users to deploy, mint, and transfer Rune tokens on their own.  
This project is built using JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js, offering a robust and scalable solution for managing Rune tokens efficiently across the network.

## Installation

To set up the Rune-Fractal Launchpad on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rizzolib/rune-fractal-launchpad.git
    cd rune-fractal-launchpad
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To start the Rune-Fractal Launchpad, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will launch the server, and you can interact with the API endpoints as described below.

## Features

- **Token Deployment:** Easily deploy new Rune tokens within the network.
- **Minting Process Monitoring:** Track the progress of token minting.
- **Token Transfer:** Securely transfer Rune tokens to other addresses.
- **Scalability:** Built using Node.js and TypeScript for efficient scaling.
- **Robust API:** Provides a comprehensive API for interacting with Rune tokens.

## API Endpoints

Here are the key API endpoints provided by the Rune-Fractal Launchpad:

### Token Management

- **Deploy Token**

  ```http
  POST /api/tokens/deploy
  ```

  This endpoint allows users to deploy a new Rune token.

- **Mint Token**

  ```http
  POST /api/tokens/mint
  ```

  Used to initiate the minting process for tokens.

- **Transfer Token**

  ```http
  POST /api/tokens/transfer
  ```

  Allows the transfer of Rune tokens to a specified address.

### Example Code

Below is a sample code snippet used to create a new Rune token:

```typescript
import { TokenService } from './services/TokenService';

const tokenService = new TokenService();

// Example function to deploy a new token
async function deployToken(tokenName: string, initialSupply: number) {
  try {
    await tokenService.deployToken(tokenName, initialSupply);
    console.log(`Token ${tokenName} deployed with an initial supply of ${initialSupply}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deploying token:', error);
  }
}

// Sample usage
deployToken('RuneToken', 1000000);
```

## Configuration

The configuration settings can be adjusted by modifying the `tsconfig.json` file, which includes options for TypeScript compilation settings. Ensure that `"strict": true` is set to enable strict type-checking, enhancing code reliability [citation:9][citation:10].

## Testing

Testing is conducted using a suite of automated tests to ensure the robustness of the launchpad [citation:9]. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
npm test
```
